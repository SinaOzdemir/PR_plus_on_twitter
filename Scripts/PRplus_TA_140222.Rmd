# Point of departure

## Motivation

-   The EU and related matters have been -perhaps irreversibly- politicized[@DeWilde2012]

-   Consequently, there is an increased scrutiny of the EU affairs

-   The EU, especially the executives, have a well documented communication problem [@Meyer1999;@Rauh2019;@Rauh2021]

-   Social media channels bear many promises to elevate some of these problems[@Bossetta2017;@Mergel2013]

-   Main RQ: *"How and to what extend the EU executives employ different public communication strategies on social media?"*

# Theory

## Core-concepts

**Legitimation**: Engaging in nurturing the belief in their claim to rule among relevant audiences [@Tallberg2019;@Weber1978,p.450]

    - Our research question pertains to the relationship between public communication
    and discursive legitimation

**Public communication strategies**: a set of deliberate and purposive communication activities enacted by a communication agent in the public sphere on behalf of a communication entity to reach established goals that are informed by multiple perspectives [@Werder2020,p.80]

---

-   Three common public communication strategies [@Waters2011;@Suen2006]

    1)  *One-way communication*: Strategy that aims to deliver messages from the organization to the relevant audience
    2)  *Two-way asymmetric communication*: Strategy that aims to collect opinions and feedback from organization's audience
    3)  *Two-way symmetric communication*: Strategy that aims to stimulate a bilateral dialogue between the audience and the organization

---

-   Different strategies then can contribute to the legitimacy by establishing and enhancing various aspects of good governance

-   Specifically:

    1)  Good impression: Creating or reinforcing favorable opinion about the organization among the audience
    2)  Transparency: Creating opportunities to increase openness by reducing the cost of disseminating and access to information
    3)  Interactivity: Developing better connection with stakeholders
    4)  Participation: Creating opportunity to give audience and stakeholders a voice in the governance process

---

-   We translate these into the EU literature

|                       | Output legitimacy | Throughput legitimacy | Input legitimacy |
|-----------------------|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------:|
| One-way communication |  Good-impression  |     Transparency      |        \-        |
| Two-way asymmetric    |        \-         |          \-           |  Interactivity   |
| Two-way symmetric     |        \-         |          \-           |  Participation   |


## Operationalizations:

**One-way communication**:

Content types:

    - Activity reporting: information on the institutions or actors'
      day-to-day operations such as meetings, travels, handshakes.

    - Output reporting: information, such as policy goals and results,
      economic growth figures, amount of vaccinated people,
      information on how to benefit from a policy.
      
    - Identity and mandate: information about the mission, mandate,
      aims and goals of the EU, its institutions and bureaucrats.
      
       
    - Opinion: information on preference or evaluation regarding some policy,
      activity or situation. Verbs that express a desire whilst portraying
      the actor as not fully in control of the outcome are indicative of an Opinion

---

**Two-way asymmetric communication**:

    - Input seeking: Messages that announce events or opportunities
      such as online forms for the stakeholders and
      broader public to give feedback or express their
      opinion on political operations of the EU
       
    - Mentions: @mentions on tweets to other Twitter users.
       

**Two-way symmetric communication**:

    - Direct Replies: Replying to other Twitter users
    - Conversational replies: Replies to other Twitter users under author's post.

## Data and Method

-   Manual content analysis

-   113 verified Twitter accounts of the EU supranational executive institutions and their heads

-   Stratified proportional random sample of tweets (N= 4630) from 01.12.2019 - 31.07.2020

-   About 25% of the sample is currently coded

# Pre-eliminary results

## One-way communication

```{r oop_perc, fig.align='center',out.height="70%",out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"overall_oop_perc.jpeg"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Favorite message types of Executives

```{r oop_by_account,fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"top_accounts_by_message_type.jpeg"))
```

## Transparency in communication

-   We also code for mentioned actors in the tweets to gauge transparency in communication

    -   Self: the author of the tweet writes about themselves
    -   Other actors: the author of the tweet talks about other political and societal actors in their tweet
    -   Compound: the author of the tweet talks about a set of actors that includes the author in their tweet
    -   None: No individual or institution is mentioned in the tweet

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   We specifically focus on output messages and mentioned actors to gauge the transparency

```{r transparency_overall, fig.align='center',out.height= "50%",out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path, "transparency_overall_perc.jpeg"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r sop_by_actor,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path, "peak_transparent_atypes.jpeg"))
```

## Two-way communication

```{r sop_Favs, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"engagement_by_actor_type.jpeg"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r retweet_network, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE,out.height="120%",out.width="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"retweet_network.jpeg"))
```

## Impact on engagement

We also examine the implications of different communication strategies for the engagement with messages on social media for executives

$$ Engagement_i \approx \beta_0 + \beta_iSoP_i + \beta_iOoP_i$$

-   Engagement: $$ Log(\frac{retweets_i + favorites_i}{followercount_j}) $$

-   SoP: type of actors mentioned in the tweet

-   OoP: type of content in the tweet

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r dv_dist, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"dv_density_plots.jpeg"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r reg_res, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE,out.height="100%",out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(graph_path,"regression_results.jpeg"))
```

## Conclusions

-   Results from mapping the communication:

    -   One way communication strategy is the bread and butter of the EU executives communication on Twitter
      
    -   The executives seem to rely mostly on output legitimacy

    -   In terms of transparency, individually taking responsibility seems rather rare.
        However, they are happy to report thier agency with their insitutional identity or
        sharing the credit with everyone involved in the process

    -   Two-way communication strategies are not very popular among the executive actors and institutions.
    
    -   When they do employ two-way communication strategy,
        they seem to prefer the most anodine two-way asymetric communication strategy
        by mostly retweeting other EU accounts.

- Implication of the communication regarding the engagement:

    - Current communciation strategies seem quite rational 
    
    - Normative "ideal" of democratic communication does not seem to pay off with regards to the currency of social media (i.e engagement)
    
    
---

- A few caveats about the results:

    - The distribution of the dependent variable is not perfectly normal, so some results might be slightly biased
    
    - Outliers were not excluded in the preliminary analysis.
    
    - Operationalization of the dependent variable includes retweets 
      which may greatly influence the results due to endogenous dynamics of the EUsphere.
      
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Further analysis ideas:

    -   Extend the analysis to full population of messages
    -   Conduct a deeper analysis of engagement by including replies and examining diversity of retweeters
    -   Analyze the time trends in the communication
    -   Compare the EU executive communication with peers such as national executives and international executives
    -   Examine interaction effects in different message types and factor in transparency and two-way communication
